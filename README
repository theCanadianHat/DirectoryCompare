Description: This is a graphic user interface for project one.
It allows you to search directories for same named files. 

The Specs that I implemented are: Refactored the view.py that was
given to us as a starting point. This program allows you to Search
for same named file, compare files on their content, rename files
and delete files. 

The Specs that I was unable to implement are:

Extras: byte compare, rename, delete
